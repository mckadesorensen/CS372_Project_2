After shape is generated you can use helper function printPostScript to print the post script to a ostream of your choice.
# Features:
Stacked Shapes
Layered Shapes

One Custom Shape that is a face.
# Notes
This module was created for a school project, There is a test suite to ensure the CPS is generating the right sized squares.
There is not a way to ensure post script is legal. 
If you would like to add a new custom shape then open a PR.
